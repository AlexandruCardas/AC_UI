# AC_UI
Object Oriented Programming Assignment programmed on Java along with Processing libraries. The theme this year is futuristic user interfaces. I picked a user interface that I always loved since day one, and that is the Assassin's Creed 1 animus menu. Although slim in terms in interaction, the menu itself does have some complexity in its design.

This assignment is meant to test and improve our understanding of Java, OOP fundamentals and version control with Git and GitHub.

> Project designed on a MacBook Pro laptop with latest version of macOS Mojave, it does not include libraries for any other operating systems.

# Instructions

**No keyboard required**

Wait for setup animations to finish and then the main menu is displayed. The first part consists of a typewriter effect that displays the current location and the current date. The second one is a loading screen with the Abstergo logo in the middle of the screen and a loading text with changing alpha levels.

## Main

This is the default option for the menu. When it is active, the double helix is displayed in the middle of the screen until a different menu option is chosen.

## Options

This option is used to control the volume of the music. Once the button for options is clicked, two other buttons will appear on the screen, one for increasing and one for decreasing the volume. To go back to the main menu, simply click the main button.

## Exit

This option is self explanatory. Once clicked, it will exit and terminate the program instantly.

# Behind the Scenes

There is magic involved. Just kidding.


# Pride Points

## 3D

One of the aspects of project that was not covered in class is the 3D implementation. I use P3D to create spheres and boxes for my double helix DNA representation. I wanted to implement a 3D camera as well but it interfered with the coordinates of the buttons and it made them unreliable and so I had to remove it.


## Learning

I did learn a great deal of Java while building this small project. I 

## Code

My main focus was on the cleanliness of the code and its simplicity. There are no redundant lines of code and the same goes for DRY code.

## Design

Everything displayed on the screen is responsive. I spent a great deal of time making each element symmetric and engineered the parameters in such a way that regardless of the screen size, everything will scale accordingly and look consistent across any device.

# Regretful Moments

## Time Management

I started working on this project relatively early but I had periods of time where I did not even look at the code. 

## Unfinished Business

I wanted to implement two other features to the interface, one being a fading in-and-out chemical formula across the screen and the other was a DNA inspector. I spent most of my time in improving the code that I already had and so I decided that scraping these two elements was the necessary thing to do due to time limitations. Moreover I a wanted to use more vectors instead of only having one.
