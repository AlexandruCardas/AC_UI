# AC_UI
OOP Assignment programmed on Java along with Processing libraries. The theme this year is futuristic UIs. I picked a user interface that I always loved since day one, and that is the Assassin's Creed 1 animus menu.

# Instructions

This is the default option for the menu. When it is active, the double helix is displayed in the middle of the screen until a different menu option is chosen.

# Behind the Scenes

# Pride Points

## Code
My main focus was on the cleanliness of the code and its simplicity. DRY code is minimalised and there are no redundant lines of code.

## Design
Everything displayed on the screen is responsive. I spent a great deal of time making each element and setting its parameters in such a way that regardless of the screen size, everything will scale accordingly.
